Job Sequencing Problem

Given an array of jobs where every job has a deadline and profit if the job is finished
before the deadline. It is also given that every job takes a single unit of time, so the
minimum possible deadline for any job is 1. Maximize the total profit if only one job can
be scheduled at a time.

Job A = 4, 20
Job B = 1, 10
Job C = 1, 40
Job D = 1, 30

ans = C, A*/
